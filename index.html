        <h3>Origins of Ice Hockey</h3>
    <p>
    Ice hockey originated in Canada in the mid-19th century,
     developing from various stick-and-ball games played on frozen
      ponds and rivers during winter. The sport began to take a more
       organized form in the 1870s, with the first recorded indoor game 
       played in 1875 at the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal. Early versions
        of hockey used basic equipment and loosely defined rules, but as the
         game grew in popularity, standardized regulations were established
          to improve safety and consistency. Over time, ice hockey spread beyond
           Canada to the United States and Europe, eventually becoming a fast-paced,
            highly competitive sport played professionally around the world.
